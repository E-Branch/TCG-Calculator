# TCG-Calculator
Calculator for calculating probabilities and statistics for Trading Card Games (TCGs). Plan to make it generic so it can be used for multiple TCGs. Would like to include practice hands, graphs, utomating complex probability calculations. It would also be nice to include things like automatically handling resourses, searching effects, etc in these calculations.
